# Vacation-Vibes


## Description 

Using two separate APIs we created an app that fuses together two two things that embody a region with food and music.  In our app, you can travel to a country of your choice with a click of a button. By clicking on your favorite country you receive an image of the country, a delicious dish with its name, an image, a recipe to prepare your dish and a radio station with music to fit the vibe of your selected country. 

In the future we plan to add wider varieties of locations, recipes, music styles and radio station options. 
We are also hoping to add integration with neuralink for full immersion.
